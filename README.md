# Adaptive Draggable Pane Layout in Jetpack Compose

This project demonstrates an adaptive layout in Jetpack Compose with draggable panes. The layout consists of two panes: a left pane with default slide and fade animations and a right pane that uses simple fade-in and fade-out animations. The user can resize the left pane using a draggable divider.

## Features

- **Adaptive Layout**: The layout adjusts based on screen size.
- **Draggable Divider**: Users can resize the left pane by dragging the divider.
- **Custom Animations**:
    - Left Pane: Fades in and slides from the left, fades out and slides to the left.
    - Right Pane: Fades in and out without any sliding motion.
- **Visibility Toggles**: Buttons to toggle the visibility of the left and right panes.
